##To do
- [ ] Get fancy and put dep control into my stuff

###Alignment Macro
- [ ] have macro change \move tags appropriately aswell.
- [ ] Figure out why line shifts slightly down when different fonts are present, but when cycled all the way through  still returns to start position (possibly indicating it's not a bounding box issue?)

###Lib stuff
- [ ] Improve chrolo.lib's TextBound function to handle: \shad, \fax, \fry, \frx... etc
- [ ] Add ability to determine default line position when \pos not specified.
- [ ] Turns out some tags, like \fad, will apply to the whole line no matter where they're placed. My current setup can't handle this...

###KFX lib stuff
- [ ] Change how shuffle text's extra data is prepended

- [ ] actually do kfx for a show to test my stuff

- [ ] add millions more effects to the effect library

- [ ] get "QuickKFX" up to a working standard (soonâ„¢)

###Misc
- [ ] get used to github markdown language
